## High Priority
- Update growth metrics calculation to use median stratification approach
- Add new growth by stratum view on either Market Overview or Location Insights page
- Update to using price/sq ft for time-series visualizations (probably add exponential smoothing)
- Simplify community insights to avoid spurious analytical takeaways. (do roll-ups where necessary)
- Update PriceGuessr to show final guess before going to end screen. (this is super annoying!!!)

### Medium Priority
- Update/Test price estimation model with $/sq ft. Perhaps attempt more involved stratification.
- Add new regions to better capture property distributions (eg. rural, north coast, other urban areas)
