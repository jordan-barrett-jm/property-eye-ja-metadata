> The purpose of a system is what it does

~ Stafford Beer


Completely ignoring that [elegant dictum from Mr Beer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does), I'll start off with what the _intention_ is for PropertyEyeJA before I get into what it **is**.

PropertyEyeJA aims to provide insight into the Jamaican real estate market in an accessible (mostly) manner, attempting to provide some amount of information symmetry among market participants.

In short, this platform/web app/data source **should** make it wayyyy easier for you to glean some insight into an otherwise opaque (IMO) market. 


## Not so frequently asked questions

### What is PropertyEyeJA?
It's a fun project that I will try to tinker with and iteratively improve

### Do I have to pay you?
Well, first I don't think we've been acquainted and I'm not entirely sure if this is **valuable** to you. So, first how about you try to use it and then we can talk about compensation a bit later on? For now, you can pay me by making the usage numbers go up.

### How do you get the data?
The same way that you do! Real estate data is, thankfully, pretty abundant however disorganized. I access it from public listing sources, clean it, and drop it here for your convenience.
Enriching the data might involve adding accessory data sources like povery data, some inference from satellite imagery, and, of course, input from _AI_. 

### How reliable is the data?

With that being said, I've eye-balled it and cleaned it and de-duplicated it and in my **gut** says it looks _reasonably_ good (barring sample size issues for granular filters). Obviously, you should verify it ([like with any data source](https://www.global-developments.org/p/how-much-should-we-trust-developing).

### On the (in)accuracy of the Price Estimation Model
I spent a few weeks on another projecting working on the Real Estate price estimation model with the hopes that I could replicate [Zillow's Zestimate accuracy rate](https://www.zillow.com/z/zestimate/) which has a median error rate of around 2.4%. 

The idea was that if I could have a model that predicted valuations with sub-5% error rates I could reliably identify arbitrage opportunities then [some steps in between] and profit.

Unfortunately for me (and perhaps fortunately for you) that was **not** possible for me with my woefully inadequate dataset. Below I've included a snapshot of the median error rate by parish so you can get an idea of how much you can trust the values produced by the model.

Bear in mind that I don't guarantee any level of accuracy and the model is **at best** directionally interesting to look at...for now ðŸ¤ž
